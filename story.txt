There once was an ugly barnicle. His name was Barny, and he lived deep under the sea. He was so ugly that no underwater predator dared eat him, out of fear of becoming ugly. Therefore, Barny lived out most of his days in peace.
	One day Barny peered out his hole.  In front of him stood, a yellow man named Bob.  The man took out his spatula and put Barny on a grill.  Bob then added two buns and formed Barny into a patty and called it a barny patty.
However, the barny patty tasted very bad. The yellow man just called to his blue man called Tom to finish it.

Tom was the best ugly barnicle chef in all the land. Using his signiture blue, he could make any barnicle taste amazing. So he started working on barny. He spent night and day preping barny and making the barny patty as good as he could make it. At the end, he presented the barny patty to his green friend Steve.

Steve was very green, and therefore loves ugly barnicle patties. He has tried every barnicle patty known to the sea creature community, and is often considered the most affluent ugly barnicle eater in the entire sea. When bob contacted Steve, steve was very excited to try this new, very ugly barnicle. But this barnicle was not what steve had expected at all.
