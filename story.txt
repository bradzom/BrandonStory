There once was an ugly barnicle. His name was Barny, and he lived deep under the sea. He was so ugly that no underwater predator dared eat him, out of fear of becoming ugly. Therefore, Barny lived out most of his days in peace.
	One day Barny peered out his hole.  In front of him stood, a yellow man named Bob.  The man took out his spatula and put Barny on a grill.  Bob then added two buns and formed Barny into a patty and called it a barny patty.
However, the barny patty tasted very bad. The yellow man just called to his blue man calledTom to finish it.
